# Computer Communications REPO
###Repository of HW's and Labs for my ELEC331 Computer Communications Course with some personal security optimisations.
##TCP Server
Composed of four different files, Python scripts are the client side and server side, TCPClient.py and TCPServer.py respectedly. THen a error404.html to prompt to user in case of error and the index.html to display data provided by the user.

##UDP Pinger
Composed of two files, UDPServer to simulate a randomized lost packet module, this code is taken exactly from course slides. UDPPingerCLient.py using time module, utilizes current time and end time to provide feedback on ping number and time taken for response.


##TODO:
- [x] Upload working versions of code
- [ ] Add encryption to TCP Server
- [ ] Ease use and add real ping communications.
- [ ] add get infor based on IP muodule from DNS providers.
